# Wikistuff
This is a bunch of wiki-related notes related to Bloons Wiki and coding for it. It is quite messy, but it's a nice workspace to look at some code-related magic for the sake of Bloons sciences.

# Key
* README.md
  * Obviously the readme file
* beginstuff
  * I don't know... possibly just the beginning of creating this repository?
* dreadbloonresistance.py
  * Python file for testing out Dreadbloon resistance suggestion stuff
* gridbeasthander.py
  * Gridding the Beast Handler table data smoothly  
* list_of_errored_apopalypse_seeds_by_jessiepatch
  * This is a copy of Jessie Patch's error seed information. They DMed me "broken seeds" and sent me this big list of errored seeds that crashed. Sorted in numerical order.
  * More quotes by Jessie Patch:
    * *There seems to be up to 529 total according to them.*
    * *Any round can crash*
    * *also, for the other rounds, it's simply those seeds - (round - 1)*
    * *since the round # and initial seed are added together*
    * *even round 200 can crash*
    * *even though there's only one possible combination there, lol*
    * *So basically, if one round breaks, all the other ones are broken too*
* t5stuff
  * A copy-paste effort to allow easy renaming of bits of code for semi-automated purposes
* wikiversionhistories
  * Copy-paste for the creation of Balance Change subpages for BTD6 balance change stuff
